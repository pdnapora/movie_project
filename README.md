##The Movie Website project is the first project due for the
##[Udacity](http://www.udacity.com) Fullstack Nanodegree program.

The project uses a class `Movie` within the `media.py` file to emulate each 
movie that is represented on the website.

It also uses `entertainment_center.py` to instantiate the movie objects and
store them in a list variable, `movies`, which is then passed to the 
`open_movies_page` method that came furnished with the provided `fresh_tomatoes.py`. 

The project dynamically generates tiled movie objects on the web page and 
the user can interact by clicking on each movie poster image to open a 
youtube trailer which opens in a modal window.
